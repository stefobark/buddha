1	THE TWIN-VERSES	All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage.
2	THE TWIN-VERSES	All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.
3	THE TWIN-VERSES	'He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,'--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.
4	THE TWIN-VERSES	'He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,'--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.
5	THE TWIN-VERSES	For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is an old rule.
6	THE TWIN-VERSES	The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.
7	THE TWIN-VERSES	He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled, immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the tempter) will certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.
8	THE TWIN-VERSES	He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.
9	THE TWIN-VERSES	He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of the yellow dress.
10	THE TWIN-VERSES	But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of the yellow dress.
11	THE TWIN-VERSES	They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.
12	THE TWIN-VERSES	They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at truth, and follow true desires.
13	THE TWIN-VERSES	As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break through an unreflecting mind.
14	THE TWIN-VERSES	As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will not break through a well-reflecting mind.
15	THE TWIN-VERSES	The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in the next; he mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own work.
16	THE TWIN-VERSES	The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the purity of his own work.
17	THE TWIN-VERSES	The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he suffers more when going on the evil path.
18	THE TWIN-VERSES	The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.
19	THE TWIN-VERSES	The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is like a cowherd counting the cows of others.
20	THE TWIN-VERSES	The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness, possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.
21	ON EARNESTNESS	Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana), thoughtlessness the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are thoughtless are as if dead already.
22	ON EARNESTNESS	Those who are advanced in earnestness, having understood this clearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the knowledge of the Ariyas (the elect).
23	ON EARNESTNESS	These wise people, meditative, steady, always possessed of strong powers, attain to Nirvana, the highest happiness.
24	ON EARNESTNESS	If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not forgetful, if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he restrains himself, and lives according to law,--then his glory will increase.
25	ON EARNESTNESS	By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.
26	ON EARNESTNESS	Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps earnestness as his best jewel.
27	ON EARNESTNESS	Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust! He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.
28	ON EARNESTNESS	When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.
29	ON EARNESTNESS	Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.
30	ON EARNESTNESS	By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.
31	ON EARNESTNESS	A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters, small or large.
32	ON EARNESTNESS	A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he is close upon Nirvana.
33	THOUGHT	As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard, difficult to hold back.
34	THOUGHT	As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground, our thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mara (the tempter).
35	THOUGHT	It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.
36	THOUGHT	Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well guarded bring happiness.
37	THOUGHT	Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone, is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).
38	THOUGHT	If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true law, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be perfect.
39	THOUGHT	If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind is not perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no fear for him while he is watchful.
40	THOUGHT	Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara (the tempter) with the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should never rest.
41	THOUGHT	Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised, without understanding, like a useless log.
42	THOUGHT	Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to an enemy, a wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.
43	THOUGHT	Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other relative; a well-directed mind will do us greater service.
44	FLOWERS	Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama (the lord of the departed), and the world of the gods? Who shall find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower?
45	FLOWERS	The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the world of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.
46	FLOWERS	He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of Mara, and never see the king of death.
47	FLOWERS	Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.
48	FLOWERS	Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is distracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.
49	FLOWERS	As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower, or its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in his village.
50	FLOWERS	Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice of.
51	FLOWERS	Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.
52	FLOWERS	But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.
53	FLOWERS	As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.
54	FLOWERS	The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good people travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.
55	FLOWERS	Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.
56	FLOWERS	Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.
57	FLOWERS	Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true knowledge, Mara, the tempter, never finds the way.
58	FLOWERS	As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.
59	FLOWERS	As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.
60	THE FOOL	Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.
61	THE FOOL	If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with a fool.
62	THE FOOL	'These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me,' with such thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how much less sons and wealth?
63	THE FOOL	The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.
64	THE FOOL	If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.
65	THE FOOL	If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste of soup.
66	THE FOOL	Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.
67	THE FOOL	That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.
68	THE FOOL	No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.
69	THE FOOL	As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.
70	THE FOOL	Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle of those who have well weighed the law.
71	THE FOOL	An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly); smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.
72	THE FOOL	And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.
73	THE FOOL	Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!
74	THE FOOL	'May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be done or is not to be done,' thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire and pride increase.
75	THE FOOL	'One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads to Nirvana;' if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this, he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the world.
76	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs, follow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow him.
77	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.
78	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of men.
79	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage rejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).
80	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.
81	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not amidst blame and praise.
82	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.
83	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle, longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people never appear elated or depressed.
84	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good, wise, and virtuous.
85	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.
86	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to overcome.
87	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind.
88	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind.
89	THE WISE MAN (PANDITA)	Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of light, are free (even) in this world.
90	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all fetters.
91	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they are not happy in their abode; like swans who have left their lake, they leave their house and home.
92	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food, who have perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), their path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.
93	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment, who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), his path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.
94	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by the driver, have been subdued, who is free from pride, and free from appetites.
95	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth, like Indra's bolt; he is like a lake without mud; no new births are in store for him.
96	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has obtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus become a quiet man.
97	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the greatest of men.
98	THE VENERABLE (ARHAT)	In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land, wherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.
99	THE THOUSANDS	Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word of sense is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.
100	THE THOUSANDS	Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word of a Gatha is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.
101	THE THOUSANDS	Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of senseless words, one word of the law is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.
102	THE THOUSANDS	If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if another conquer himself, he is the greatest of conquerors.
103	THE THOUSANDS	One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not even a god, a Gandharva, not Mara with Brahman could change into defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under restraint.
104	THE THOUSANDS	One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not even a god, a Gandharva, not Mara with Brahman could change into defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under restraint.
105	THE THOUSANDS	If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after month with a thousand, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years.
106	THE THOUSANDS	If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in the forest, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years.
107	THE THOUSANDS	Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit, the whole of it is not worth a quarter (a farthing); reverence shown to the righteous is better.
108	THE THOUSANDS	He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged, four things will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.
109	THE THOUSANDS	But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting.
110	THE THOUSANDS	And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting.
111	THE THOUSANDS	And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a life of one day is better if a man has attained firm strength.
112	THE THOUSANDS	And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing beginning and end, a life of one day is better if a man sees beginning and end.
113	THE THOUSANDS	And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the immortal place, a life of one day is better if a man sees the immortal place.
114	THE THOUSANDS	And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the highest law, a life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law.
115	Evil	If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his mind delights in evil.
116	Evil	If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.
117	Evil	If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in it: happiness is the outcome of good.
118	Evil	Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer see evil.
119	Evil	Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see happy days.
120	Evil	Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by little.
121	Evil	Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little by little.
122	Evil	Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions and carries much wealth, avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves life avoids poison.
123	Evil	He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand; poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one who does not commit evil.
124	Evil	If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.
125	Evil	Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvana.
126	Evil	Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).
127	Evil	Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).
128	PUNISHMENT	All men tremble at punishment, all men fear death; remember that you are like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.
129	PUNISHMENT	All men tremble at punishment, all men love life; remember that thou art like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.
130	PUNISHMENT	He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills beings who also long for happiness, will not find happiness after death.
131	PUNISHMENT	He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or kill beings who also long for happiness, will find happiness after death.
132	PUNISHMENT	Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are spoken to will answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful, blows for blows will touch thee.
133	PUNISHMENT	If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter not, then thou hast reached Nirvana; contention is not known to thee.
134	PUNISHMENT	As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable, so do Age and Death drive the life of men.
135	PUNISHMENT	A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds: but the wicked man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.
136	PUNISHMENT	He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless persons, will soon come to one of these ten states:
137	PUNISHMENT	He will have cruel suffering, loss, injury of the body, heavy affliction, or loss of mind,
138	PUNISHMENT	Or a misfortune coming from the king, or a fearful accusation, or loss of relations, or destruction of treasures,
139	PUNISHMENT	Or lightning-fire will burn his houses; and when his body is destroyed, the fool will go to hell.
140	PUNISHMENT	Not nakedness, not platted hair, not dirt, not fasting, or lying on the earth, not rubbing with dust, not sitting motionless, can purify a mortal who has not overcome desires.
141	PUNISHMENT	He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity, is quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to find fault with all other beings, he indeed is a Brahmana, an ascetic (sramana), a friar (bhikshu).
142	PUNISHMENT	Is there in this world any man so restrained by humility that he does not mind reproof, as a well-trained horse the whip?
143	PUNISHMENT	Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip, be ye active and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof), perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.
144	PUNISHMENT	Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; good people fashion themselves.
145	OLD AGE	How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?
146	OLD AGE	Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds, joined together, sickly, full of many thoughts, which has no strength, no hold!
147	OLD AGE	This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death.
148	OLD AGE	Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what pleasure is there in looking at them?
149	OLD AGE	After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it is covered with flesh and blood, and there dwell in it old age and death, pride and deceit.
150	OLD AGE	The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people never approaches destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.
151	OLD AGE	A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows, but his knowledge does not grow.
152	OLD AGE	Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him); and painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all desires.
153	OLD AGE	Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him); and painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all desires.
154	OLD AGE	Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a lake without fish.
155	OLD AGE	Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.
156	SELF	If a man hold himself dear, let him watch himself carefully; during one at least out of the three watches a wise man should be watchful.
157	SELF	Let each man direct himself first to what is proper, then let him teach others; thus a wise man will not suffer.
158	SELF	If a man make himself as he teaches others to be, then, being himself well subdued, he may subdue (others); one's own self is indeed difficult to subdue.
159	SELF	Self is the lord of self, who else could be the lord? With self well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find.
160	SELF	The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred, crushes the foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.
161	SELF	He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state where his enemy wishes him to be, as a creeper does with the tree which it surrounds.
162	SELF	Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy to do; what is beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.
163	SELF	The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable (Arahat), of the elect (Ariya), of the virtuous, and follows false doctrine, he bears fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of the Katthaka reed.
164	SELF	By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity belong to oneself, no one can purify another.
165	SELF	Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another's, however great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty, be always attentive to his duty.
166	THE WORLD	Do not follow the evil law! Do not live on in thoughtlessness! Do not follow false doctrine! Be not a friend of the world.
167	THE WORLD	Rouse thyself! do not be idle! Follow the law of virtue! The virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.
168	THE WORLD	Follow the law of virtue; do not follow that of sin. The virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.
169	THE WORLD	Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a mirage: the king of death does not see him who thus looks down upon the world.
170	THE WORLD	Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not touch it.
171	THE WORLD	He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober, brightens up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.
172	THE WORLD	He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.
173	THE WORLD	This world is dark, few only can see here; a few only go to heaven, like birds escaped from the net.
174	THE WORLD	The swans go on the path of the sun, they go through the ether by means of their miraculous power; the wise are led out of this world, when they have conquered Mara and his train.
175	THE WORLD	If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies, and scoffs at another world, there is no evil he will not do.
176	THE WORLD	The uncharitable do not go to the world of the gods; fools only do not praise liberality; a wise man rejoices in liberality, and through it becomes blessed in the other world.
177	THE WORLD	Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the reward of the first step in holiness.
178	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	He whose conquest is not conquered again, into whose conquest no one in this world enters, by what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?
179	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	He whom no desire with its snares and poisons can lead astray, by what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?
180	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not forgetful, who are given to meditation, who are wise, and who delight in the repose of retirement (from the world).
181	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Difficult (to obtain) is the conception of men, difficult is the life of mortals, difficult is the hearing of the True Law, difficult is the birth of the Awakened (the attainment of Buddhahood).
182	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify one's mind, that is the teaching of (all) the Awakened.
183	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	The Awakened call patience the highest penance, long-suffering the highest Nirvana; for he is not an anchorite (pravragita) who strikes others, he is not an ascetic (sramana) who insults others.
184	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained under the law, to be moderate in eating, to sleep and sit alone, and to dwell on the highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the Awakened.
185	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of gold pieces; he who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain, he is wise;
186	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction, the disciple who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction of all desires.
187	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Men, driven by fear, go to many a refuge, to mountains and forests, to groves and sacred trees.
188	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	But that is not a safe refuge, that is not the best refuge; a man is not delivered from all pains after having gone to that refuge.
189	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	He who takes refuge with Buddha, the Law, and the Church; he who, with clear understanding, sees the four holy truths:--
190	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Viz. pain, the origin of pain, the destruction of pain, and the eightfold holy way that leads to the quieting of pain;--
191	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	That is the safe refuge, that is the best refuge; having gone to that refuge, a man is delivered from all pain.
192	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	A supernatural person (a Buddha) is not easily found, he is not born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race prospers.
193	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	Happy is the arising of the awakened, happy is the teaching of the True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the devotion of those who are at peace.
194	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be measured by anybody.
195	THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED)	He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be measured by anybody.
196	HAPPINESS	Let us live happily then, not hating those who hate us! among men who hate us let us dwell free from hatred!
197	HAPPINESS	Let us live happily then, free from ailments among the ailing! among men who are ailing let us dwell free from ailments!
198	HAPPINESS	Let us live happily then, free from greed among the greedy! among men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed!
199	HAPPINESS	Let us live happily then, though we call nothing our own! We shall be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness!
200	HAPPINESS	Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has given up both victory and defeat, he, the contented, is happy.
201	HAPPINESS	There is no fire like passion; there is no losing throw like hatred; there is no pain like this body; there is no happiness higher than rest.
202	HAPPINESS	Hunger is the worst of diseases, the body the greatest of pains; if one knows this truly, that is Nirvana, the highest happiness.
203	HAPPINESS	Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches; trust is the best of relationships, Nirvana the highest happiness.
204	HAPPINESS	He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity, is free from fear and free from sin, while he tastes the sweetness of drinking in the law.
205	HAPPINESS	The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with them is always happiness; if a man does not see fools, he will be truly happy.
206	HAPPINESS	He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way; company with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company with the wise is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.
207	HAPPINESS	Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the stars.
208	PLEASURE	He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure, will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.
209	PLEASURE	Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant. Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is unpleasant.
210	PLEASURE	Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil. Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.
211	PLEASURE	From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is free from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.
212	PLEASURE	From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.
213	PLEASURE	From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from lust knows neither grief nor fear.
214	PLEASURE	From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from love knows neither grief nor fear.
215	PLEASURE	From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free from greed knows neither grief nor fear.
216	PLEASURE	He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear.
217	PLEASURE	He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvana) has sprung up, who is satisfied in his mind, and whose thoughts are not bewildered by love, he is called urdhvamsrotas (carried upwards by the stream).
218	PLEASURE	Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long away, and returns safe from afar.
219	PLEASURE	In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and has gone from this world to the other;--as kinsmen receive a friend on his return.
220	ANGER	Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name and form, and who calls nothing his own.
221	ANGER	He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a real driver; other people are but holding the reins.
222	ANGER	Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by good; let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth!
223	ANGER	Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.
224	ANGER	The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body, they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where, if they have gone, they will suffer no more.
225	ANGER	Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end.
226	ANGER	This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of to-day: 'They blame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks much, they also blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed.'
227	ANGER	There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.
228	ANGER	But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river? Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman. 
229	ANGER	But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river? Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman
230	ANGER	Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the body, and with thy body practise virtue!
231	ANGER	Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!
232	ANGER	Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!
233	ANGER	The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise who control their mind, are indeed well controlled.
234	IMPURITY	Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have come near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou hast no provision for thy journey.
235	IMPURITY	Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the heavenly world of the elect (Ariya).
236	IMPURITY	Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama), there is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou hast no provision for thy journey.
237	IMPURITY	Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into birth and decay.
238	IMPURITY	Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith blows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by little, and from time to time.
239	IMPURITY	As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil path.
240	IMPURITY	The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses, non- repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman, thoughtlessness.
241	IMPURITY	Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a benefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and in the next.
242	IMPURITY	But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is the greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become taintless!
243	IMPURITY	Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.
244	IMPURITY	But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.
245	IMPURITY	He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;
246	IMPURITY	And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he, even in this world, digs up his own root.
247	IMPURITY	O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long time!
248	IMPURITY	The world gives according to their faith or according to their pleasure: if a man frets about the food and the drink given to others, he will find no rest either by day or by night.
249	IMPURITY	He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, finds rest by day and by night.
250	IMPURITY	There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.
251	IMPURITY	The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff, but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the gambler.
252	IMPURITY	If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the destruction of passions.
253	IMPURITY	There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward acts. The world delights in vanity, the Tathagatas (the Buddhas) are free from vanity.
254	IMPURITY	There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward acts. No creatures are eternal; but the awakened (Buddha) are never shaken.
255	THE JUST	A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others, not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law and intelligent, he is called just.
256	THE JUST	A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others, not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law and intelligent, he is called just.
257	THE JUST	A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free from hatred and fear, he is called learned.
258	THE JUST	A man is not a supporter of the law because he talks much; even if a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he is a supporter of the law, a man who never neglects the law.
259	THE JUST	A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be ripe, but he is called 'Old-in-vain.'
260	THE JUST	He in whom there is truth, virtue, love, restraint, moderation, he who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an elder.
261	THE JUST	An envious, greedy, dishonest man does not become respectable by means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.
262	THE JUST	He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called respectable.
263	THE JUST	Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held captive by desire and greediness?
264	THE JUST	He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil.
265	THE JUST	A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only begs.
266	THE JUST	He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.
267	THE JUST	A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e. mauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.
268	THE JUST	A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e. mauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.
269	THE JUST	A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures; because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called Ariya.
270	THE JUST	Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning, not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires.
271	THE JUST	Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning, not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires.
272	THE WAY	The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of truths the four words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has eyes to see.
273	THE WAY	This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of intelligence. Go on this way! Everything else is the deceit of Mara (the tempter).
274	THE WAY	If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way was preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns (in the flesh).
275	THE WAY	You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas (Buddhas) are only preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage of Mara.
276	THE WAY	'All created things perish,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way to purity.
277	THE WAY	'All created things are grief and pain,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.
278	THE WAY	'All forms are unreal,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.
279	THE WAY	He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak, that lazy and idle man will never find the way to knowledge.
280	THE WAY	Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the wise.
281	THE WAY	Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal knowledge is lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place himself that knowledge may grow.
282	THE WAY	Cut down the whole forest (of lust), not a tree only! Danger comes out of the forest (of lust). When you have cut down both the forest (of lust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest and free!
283	THE WAY	So long as the love of man towards women, even the smallest, is not destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk is to its mother.
284	THE WAY	Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand! Cherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by Sugata (Buddha).
285	THE WAY	'Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.
286	THE WAY	Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.
287	THE WAY	Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.
288	THE WAY	A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly clear the way that leads to Nirvana.
289	MISCELLANEOUS	If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great pleasure, let a wise man leave the small pleasure, and look to the great.
290	MISCELLANEOUS	He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain pleasure for himself, he, entangled in the bonds of hatred, will never be free from hatred.
291	MISCELLANEOUS	What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are always increasing.
292	MISCELLANEOUS	But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body, who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what ought to be done, the desires of such watchful and wise people will come to an end.
293	MISCELLANEOUS	A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two valiant kings, though he has destroyed a kingdom with all its subjects.
294	MISCELLANEOUS	A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides.
295	MISCELLANEOUS	The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha.
296	MISCELLANEOUS	The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on the law.
297	MISCELLANEOUS	The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on the church.
298	MISCELLANEOUS	The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on their body.
299	MISCELLANEOUS	The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights in compassion.
300	MISCELLANEOUS	The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights in meditation.
301	MISCELLANEOUS	It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses; painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common), and the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.
302	MISCELLANEOUS	Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated, and wealthy man chooses, there he is respected.
303	MISCELLANEOUS	Good people shine from afar, like the snowy mountains; bad people are not seen, like arrows shot by night.
304	MISCELLANEOUS	He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty of sitting alone and sleeping alone, he, subduing himself, will rejoice in the destruction of all desires alone, as if living in a forest.
305	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men with evil deeds in the next world.
306	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	Many men whose shoulders are covered with the yellow gown are ill-conditioned and unrestrained; such evil-doers by their evil deeds go to hell.
307	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball, like flaring fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on the charity of the land.
308	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets his neighbour's wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and lastly, hell.
309	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to hell), there is the short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened, and the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man think of his neighbour's wife.
310	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised asceticism leads to hell.
311	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience to discipline, all this brings no great reward.
312	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions more widely.
313	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents of it afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done it, one does not repent.
314	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences within and without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should escape, for they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain when they are in hell.
315	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be ashamed of, and are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of, such men, embracing false doctrines enter the evil path.
316	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear not when they ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path.
317	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	They who forbid when there is nothing to be forbidden, and forbid not when there is something to be forbidden, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path.
318	THE DOWNWARD COURSE	They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and what is not forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter the good path.
319	THE ELEPHANT	Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in battle endures the arrow sent from the bow: for the world is ill-natured.
320	THE ELEPHANT	They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures abuse.
321	THE ELEPHANT	Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still.
322	THE ELEPHANT	For with these animals does no man reach the untrodden country (Nirvana), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal, viz. on his own well-tamed self.
323	THE ELEPHANT	The elephant called Dhanapalaka, his temples running with sap, and difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound; the elephant longs for the elephant grove.
324	THE ELEPHANT	If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is sleepy and rolls himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on wash, is born again and again.
325	THE ELEPHANT	This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as the rider who holds the hook holds in the furious elephant.
326	THE ELEPHANT	Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.
327	THE ELEPHANT	If a man find a prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all dangers, happy, but considerate.
328	THE ELEPHANT	If a man find no prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who has left his conquered country behind,--like an elephant in the forest.
329	THE ELEPHANT	It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a fool; let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes, like an elephant in the forest.
330	THE ELEPHANT	If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is pleasant, whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the giving up of all grief is pleasant.
331	THE ELEPHANT	Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother, pleasant the state of a father, pleasant the state of a Samana, pleasant the state of a Brahmana.
332	THE ELEPHANT	Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is a faith firmly rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant is avoiding of sins.
333	THIRST	The thirst of a thoughtless man grows like a creeper; he runs from life to life, like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.
334	THIRST	Whomsoever this fierce thirst overcomes, full of poison, in this world, his sufferings increase like the abounding Birana grass.
335	THIRST	He who overcomes this fierce thirst, difficult to be conquered in this world, sufferings fall off from him, like water-drops from a lotus leaf.
336	THIRST	This salutary word I tell you, 'Do ye, as many as are here assembled, dig up the root of thirst, as he who wants the sweet-scented Usira root must dig up the Birana grass, that Mara (the tempter) may not crush you again and again, as the stream crushes the reeds.'
337	THIRST	As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is firm so long as its root is safe, and grows again, thus, unless the feeders of thirst are destroyed, the pain (of life) will return again and again.
338	THIRST	He whose thirst running towards pleasure is exceeding strong in the thirty-six channels, the waves will carry away that misguided man, viz. his desires which are set on passion.
339	THIRST	The channels run everywhere, the creeper (of passion) stands sprouting; if you see the creeper springing up, cut its root by means of knowledge.
340	THIRST	A creature's pleasures are extravagant and luxurious; sunk in lust and looking for pleasure, men undergo (again and again) birth and decay.
341	THIRST	Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare; held in fetters and bonds, they undergo pain for a long time, again and again.
342	THIRST	Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare; let therefore the mendicant drive out thirst, by striving after passionlessness for himself.
343	THIRST	He who having got rid of the forest (of lust) (i.e. after having reached Nirvana) gives himself over to forest-life (i.e. to lust), and who, when removed from the forest (i.e. from lust), runs to the forest (i.e. to lust), look at that man! though free, he runs into bondage.
344	THIRST	Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which is made of iron, wood, or hemp; far stronger is the care for precious stones and rings, for sons and a wife.
345	THIRST	That fetter wise people call strong which drags down, yields, but is difficult to undo; after having cut this at last, people leave the world, free from cares, and leaving desires and pleasures behind.
346	THIRST	Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself; when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from cares, leaving all affection behind.
347	THIRST	Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.
348	THIRST	If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong passions, and yearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will grow more and more, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.
349	THIRST	If a man delights in quieting doubts, and, always reflecting, dwells on what is not delightful (the impurity of the body, &c.), he certainly will remove, nay, he will cut the fetter of Mara.
350	THIRST	He who has reached the consummation, who does not tremble, who is without thirst and without sin, he has broken all the thorns of life: this will be his last body.
351	THIRST	He who is without thirst and without affection, who understands the words and their interpretation, who knows the order of letters (those which are before and which are after), he has received his last body, he is called the great sage, the great man.
352	THIRST	'I have conquered all, I know all, in all conditions of life I am free from taint; I have left all, and through the destruction of thirst I am free; having learnt myself, whom shall I teach?'
353	THIRST	The gift of the law exceeds all gifts; the sweetness of the law exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the law exceeds all delights; the extinction of thirst overcomes all pain.
354	THIRST	Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for the other shore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys himself, as if he were his own enemy.
355	THIRST	The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by passion: therefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings great reward.
356	THIRST	The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by hatred: therefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate brings great reward.
357	THIRST	The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by vanity: therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from vanity brings great reward.
358	THIRST	The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust: therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from lust brings great reward.
359	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the tongue.
360	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu, restrained in all things, is freed from all pain.
361	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls his speech, he who is well controlled, he who delights inwardly, who is collected, who is solitary and content, him they call Bhikshu.
362	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and calmly, who teaches the meaning and the law, his word is sweet.
363	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	He who dwells in the law, delights in the law, meditates on the law, follows the law, that Bhikshu will never fall away from the true law.
364	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Let him not despise what he has received, nor ever envy others: a mendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.
365	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he has received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if he is not slothful.
366	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.
367	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.
368	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go quickly; having cut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to Nirvana.
369	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A Bhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called Oghatinna, 'saved from the flood.'
370	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy thought to what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to swallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when burning, 'This is pain.'
371	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto Nirvana.
372	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the law clearly.
373	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong to those who know the immortal (Nirvana).
374	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.
375	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in the fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.
376	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed passion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!
377	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called quiet.
378	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!
379	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse.
380	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.
381	THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT)	He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds.
382	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires, O Brahmana! When you have understood the destruction of all that was made, you will understand that which was not made.
383	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	If the Brahmana has reached the other shore in both laws (in restraint and contemplation), all bonds vanish from him who has obtained knowledge.
384	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	He for whom there is neither this nor that shore, nor both, him, the fearless and unshackled, I call indeed a Brahmana.
385	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without passions, and who has attained the highest end, him I call indeed a Brahmana.
386	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior is bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.
387	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brahmana; because he walks quietly, therefore he is called Samana; because he has sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called Pravragita (Pabbagita, a pilgrim).
388	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana (if attacked) should let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a Brahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!
389	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds his mind back from the pleasures of life; when all wish to injure has vanished, pain will cease.
390	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or thought, and is controlled on these three points.
391	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	After a man has once understood the law as taught by the Well-awakened (Buddha), let him worship it carefully, as the Brahmana worships the sacrificial fire.
392	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is blessed, he is a Brahmana.
393	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest clean.
394	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a Brahmana.
395	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmana.
396	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut all fetters, who never trembles, is independent and unshackled.
397	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut the strap and the thong, the chain with all that pertains to it, who has burst the bar, and is awakened.
398	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, though he has committed no offence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes, who has endurance for his force, and strength for his army.
399	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is free from anger, dutiful, virtuous, without appetite, who is subdued, and has received his last body.
400	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to pleasures, like water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.
401	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, even here, knows the end of his suffering, has put down his burden, and is unshackled.
402	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose knowledge is deep, who possesses wisdom, who knows the right way and the wrong, and has attained the highest end.
403	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who keeps aloof both from laymen and from mendicants, who frequents no houses, and has but few desires.
404	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who finds no fault with other beings, whether feeble or strong, and does not kill nor cause slaughter.
405	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is tolerant with the intolerant, mild with fault-finders, and free from passion among the passionate.
406	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana from whom anger and hatred, pride and envy have dropt like a mustard seed from the point of a needle.
407	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who utters true speech, instructive and free from harshness, so that he offend no one.
408	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who takes nothing in the world that is not given him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.
409	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who fosters no desires for this world or for the next, has no inclinations, and is unshackled.
410	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has no interests, and when he has understood (the truth), does not say How, how? and who has reached the depth of the Immortal.
411	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world is above good and evil, above the bondage of both, free from grief from sin, and from impurity.
412	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is bright like the moon, pure, serene, undisturbed, and in whom all gaiety is extinct.
413	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has traversed this miry road; the impassable world and its vanity, who has gone throug, and reached the other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free from doubts, free from attachment, and content.
414	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world, leaving all desires, travels about without a home, and in whom all concupiscence is extinct.
415	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, leaving all longings, travels about without a home, and in whom all covetousness is extinct.
416	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, after leaving all bondage to men, has risen above all bondage to the gods, and is free from all and every bondage.
417	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has left what gives pleasure and what gives pain, who is cold, and free from all germs (of renewed life), the hero who has conquered all the worlds.
418	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows the destruction and the return of beings everywhere, who is free from bondage, welfaring (Sugata), and awakened (Buddha).
419	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose path the gods do not know, nor spirits (Gandharvas), nor men, whose passions are extinct, and who is an Arhat (venerable).
420	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who calls nothing his own, whether it be before, behind, or between, who is poor, and free from the love of the world.
421	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana, the manly, the noble, the hero, the great sage, the conqueror, the impassible, the accomplished, the awakened.
422	THE BRAHMANA (ARHAT)	Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows his former abodes, who sees heaven and hell, has reached the end of births, is perfect in knowledge, a sage, and whose perfections are all perfect.
